# FirstBank - BadBank

**Front End Banking Application in React**

**Description:** This is one of my first applications in React. It is a simple bank application accepting deposits and withdrawals. It focuses on managing state across components, the use of React context and rendering data using React. It has been deployed to to Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3.

**How to run:** Access the website's URL to run the application. Users can create an account by filling out the 'Creeate Account' form. The bank accepts deposit of any amount (numbers must be greater than zero). Withdrawals are not permitted if the amount exceeds the current account balance. Users can also check all transactions in the 'All Data' page. There are several validations to form fields. 

**Roadmap:** Future interesting improvements for users would be to add a button to confirm the transaction before submitting. Option to select the bill size ($20, $100) in withdrawals. Login page should also be added connected to a backend. These implementations are TBD.
